MineSweeper for Call Of Duty 4
Made by Sheep Wizard

Use run.bat to run mod, or launch mod ingame and load a map e.g. /devmap mp_crash

Top open MineSweeper menu press F7
Alternatively you can type "openscriptmenu -1 minesweeper" in console

Restart the game by pressing the Face or pressing F2

To exit MineSweeper menu press ESC, there is a 1.5 seconds delay

Mod should work on multiplayer although I havnt done any extensive testing so there may be some bugs :P
